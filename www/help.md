# Lotic AIM Custom Benchmark Tool Help

Some overview and intro text

## 1. Selecting Indicators

Lotic AIM points are shown on the map and there are two methods of choosing points for analysis: filtering and manual selection. The app will switch which points are to be used for analysis based on the selection method. If points are only filtered, all filtered points will be used in the analysis. If any points are manually selected, the selected points become the points used for analysis.

**Filtering**

Use the various filters in the left-hand side bar to choose points for analysis. You will see the result of the filtered points on the map and the *Seleced Site Visits* value in the upper left. Choosing points by filtering is often sufficient to isolate the points of interest.

**Manual Selection**

For a finer grained selection, points can be manually selected by either clicking on the point or drawing a polygon around using the map tools. Manually selected points are colored red. As soon as a manual selection is made, the app will only consider manually selected points for analysis. This will be reflected in the *Selected Site Visits* count.

IMPORTANT: If you change any of the filters after performing manual selections, the filter will override the selection and all manually selected points will be deselected.
